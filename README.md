~~# SNPMeta
SNPMeta is a tool to generate "metadata" for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for easy filtering, or submission to SNP databases. Information reported includes gene name, whether the SNP is coding or noncoding, and whether the SNP is synonymous or nonsynonymous. SNPMeta outputs in either a dbSNP submission report format, or a tab-delimited format. See the user manual for full details.~~

~~Example SNPs are from *Drosophila melanogaster*, identified in King et al. 2012. Example output for the verbose and dbSNP formats are also provided in the `Example_Data/` directory.~~
